That was hard to watch. I really hope that was rust. #PhilaUnite 
Can you imagine what this would be like if the Celtics were fully healthy? 😂 #CUsRise 
You know it’s a bad night when they put Bayless on the court... #PhilaUnite #sixers #Sixersvsceltics 
Defense didn’t hustle enough. Celtics hit open shots. Plain and simple. No overreactions. Back at it on Thursday. #PhilaUnite 
Lazy defense, 5/24 from 3, celtics shooting too good, missed free throws.. fix this up we’re gonna be good #PhilaUnite #HereTheyCome
