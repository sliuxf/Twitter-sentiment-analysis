#Celtics &amp; #Bucks are tied at 2-2 series in the game 4. #NBA #NESN #NBCSportsBoston #NBAPlayoffs 
Well I can breathe and carry on with my day now. #NBAPlayoffs #Celtics #CUsRise 
Giannis literally mugged Tatum on that rebound/tip in. Mugged.  #NBAPlayoffs 
Calling it:  J-Brown at the horn for the 3 and the win!  #NBAPlayoffs 
Brogdon is cold-blooded, a really good player #NBAPlayoffs #Game4 #Celtics #Bucks 
The Celtics are just a classier version of the Heat. Hard-nosed, tough, relentless, but play the game the right way. #NBAPlayoffs
