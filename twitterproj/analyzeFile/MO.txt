Great game in Milwaukee. Bucks coughed up a 20-point lead, but tied series going back to Boston. #NBAPlayoffs

During the #NBAPlayoffs is the only time during the year I wish I had cable 😞 
This #NBAPlayoffs is so 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 
James Harden is a Top 3 player don’t @ me 
Fairly sure Charles Barkley just said James Harden guarded by KAT is NOT a mismatch. The lack of respect is baffling @NBAonTNT 
Romney trolling Westbrook is the last thing I was expecting to see on Twitter tonight 😂 #NBAPlayoffs https://t.co/hd10S08nG6 
Do the Cavs remember how to play defense? #NBAPlayoffs #CavsVsPacers

Russell Westbrook really trying to fight every fan in that arena tonight😂😂😂 #NBAPlayoffs 
OKC had their chance...  The @utahjazz are tough!  #NBAPlayoffs #nba 
Love watching Russell Westbrook!!! Never lets up till the game is over. #NBAPlayoffs 
Did y’all see Lebron get beat by 50? Oh wait. It was only 34?   Hey I was close!   #Playoffs2018 #NBA #NBAPlayoffs 
Games where both teams just chuck up 3’s are very boring #NBAPlayoffs

Lance can slap #LeBron upside the head all he wants. But you better not grab nobody’s shoulder! #NBAonTNT #nbaofficials suck! #NBAPlayoffs 
But really it's not that @KingJames is unstoppable. Toronto just choked. Like they do. #NBAPlayoffs 
VanVleet hoops in a T-Shirt so I know he can’t fight. #NBAPlayoffs #CavsVsRaptors
